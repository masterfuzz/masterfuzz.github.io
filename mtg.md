# MTG

# Dimensions from Metric
Algorithm for estimating a metric preserving embedding of the input into
R^n which minimizes n.

"Anealing" method. embed randomly, (or a very simple "put at X: a_x+d(a,b), Y: 0...") and then set "forces" between pairs s.t. f(a,b) has equilibrium when d'(a,b) == d(a,b)o

Hyperplanes: find subsets which are relatively far from other subsets, treat subsets as points and use this as a starting plan.
